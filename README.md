File Name Validator

How to run: (Jar file is available inside FileNameValidator_jar.zip)
1.) Install JDK 24 in local machine
2.) Open cmd in jar folder location
3.) run command "java -jar FileNameValidator.jar"


Assumptions and Enchancements made:

1.) I followed the format Test_<portfoliocode>_<ddmmyyyy>_<2digit-sequencenumber>.csv indicated in the instruction
rather than the ones on the sample table for expected result. I found that the ones on the table were different from
the format on the instruction

2.) I made an enhancement wherein if the application will watch/read the folder for any changes or new files being made for
file name validation
